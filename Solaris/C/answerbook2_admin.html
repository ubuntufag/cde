</li>
<li><p>Log in on the system on which the remote AnswerBook2 server resides and bring up AnswerBook2 Admin from the CDE Front Panel.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> If administrative access control is turned on, you will be prompted to enter a valid administrative user name and password before the Administration GUI displays in the browser.</p>
